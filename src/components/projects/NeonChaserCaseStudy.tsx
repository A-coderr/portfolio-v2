              Neon Chaser is a neon-noir drift racing game built around
              physics-based driving, vehicle combat, and power-ups that can
              dramatically change the course of a race.

              The gameplay combines vehicle handling and drifting with
              offensive, defensive, and disruptive abilities. A race can shift
              from a straight fight for position into a physics-driven encounter
              involving rockets, gunfire, oil-covered track surfaces, speed
              boosts, and stolen momentum.

              extensively on save/load functionality, contributed to full level

                    Stat-based effects use runtime modifiers that can be added

                    A shared controller can decide that a power-up has been lost

                    particular effect changed.

                  <p className={narrowCopy}>
                    Nitro must remove its vehicle modifiers and stop its
                    effects. OP Hack must clean up modifications on both the
                    user and target. Weapon debuffs can expire independently.
                    Oil stops spawning when the ability ends, while slicks
                    already placed in the world continue through their own
                    lifetime. Projectiles remove themselves after impact or

                    The shared architecture therefore owns the power-up
                    lifecycle, while individual effects remain responsible for
                    cleaning up the resources and state they create.

              Neon Chaser uses JSON files stored under Unity&apos;s persistent
